Parses [Open Tri Week Workouts](http://opentri-training.com/free/ultra/index.htm) and creates a single page with all of the workouts in collapsable sections.  

## TODO
### Features
* Link for a bigger `div` to display a single day's workout
* Link to expand all days
* Remember which box was expanded when moving onto a new page

### Improvements
* Move `DD`, `DT`, `DL` to nested `UL, `LI`
* Add css classes to workout headers in a day (RUN, BIKE) and give them colors
* Less indentation of workout in a day 

### Bugs
* Generate html pages in target folder instead of html folder. copy css and js files there too

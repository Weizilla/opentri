                We begin easily enough with one short swim. Nothing too crazy here, just allow yourself some time to get used to the water again and be patient with speed.
                SWIM 0:30
                WARM UP:
                200 Swim - 2 x 100 Kick -
                4 x 50 Choice, w/10 sec rest after each
                MAIN SET:
                5 x 200 w/:20 rest, done as follows:
                (50 right arm only - 50 swim - 50 left arm only - 50 swim)
                COOL DOWN:
                2 x (50 Kick/50 Swim)

                Because the duration of each workout is relatively short today, it is possible to put them in your day together, back-to-back. However, as these durations increase it will be preferable to split these efforts within your day -- the order isn't very important right now, though we will recommend later that you perform the higher intensity bike effort first.
                BIKE 0:50
                20:00 easy spin using your small chain ring only.
                Keep your HR intensity below 65% throughout, holding your cadence to 95-105 rpm.
                20:00 time trial, bringing your HR up to 75%
                -- stay in the small chain ring & increase your HR by increasing your cadence.
                Maintain that intensity throughout this short effort
                Spin easily through the final 10:00, allowing your HR to gradually get below 60%
                RUN 0:35
                Easy reintroduction to running.
                Hold good running form throughout,
                and keep your upper body relaxed.

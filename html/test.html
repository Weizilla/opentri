                    We begin easily enough with one short swim. Nothing too crazy here, just allow yourself some time to get used to the water again and be patient with speed.
                    SWIM 0:30
                    WARM UP:
                    200 Swim - 2 x 100 Kick -
                    4 x 50 Choice, w/10 sec rest after each
                    MAIN SET:
                    5 x 200 w/:20 rest, done as follows:
                    (50 right arm only - 50 swim - 50 left arm only - 50 swim)
                    COOL DOWN:
                    2 x (50 Kick/50 Swim)
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="day pure-u-1 pure-u-lg-3-24">

                    Because the duration of each workout is relatively short today, it is possible to put them in your day together, back-to-back. However, as these durations increase it will be preferable to split these efforts within your day -- the order isn't very important right now, though we will recommend later that you perform the higher intensity bike effort first.
                    BIKE 0:50
                    20:00 easy spin using your small chain ring only.
                    Keep your HR intensity below 65% throughout, holding your cadence to 95-105 rpm.
                    20:00 time trial, bringing your HR up to 75%
                    -- stay in the small chain ring & increase your HR by increasing your cadence.
                    Maintain that intensity throughout this short effort
                    Spin easily through the final 10:00, allowing your HR to gradually get below 60%
                    RUN 0:35
                    Easy reintroduction to running.
                    Hold good running form throughout,
                    and keep your upper body relaxed.

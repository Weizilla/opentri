            Tuesday
            <BR>Because the duration of each workout
            is relatively short today, it is possible to put them in your day together,
            back-to-back. However, as these durations increase it will be preferable
            to split these efforts within your day -- the order isn't very important
            right now, though we will recommend later that you perform the higher intensity
            bike effort first.

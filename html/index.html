Because the duration of each workout<br>
is relatively short today, it is possible to put them in your day together,<br>
back-to-back. However, as these durations increase it will be preferable<br>
to split these efforts within your day -- the order isn't very important<br>
right now, though we will recommend later that you perform the higher intensity<br>
bike effort first.<br>
<br>
BIKE 0:50<br>
20:00 easy spin using your small chain ring only.<br>
Keep your HR intensity below 65% throughout, holding<br>
your cadence to 95-105 rpm.<br>
20:00 time trial, bringing your HR up to 75%<br>
-- stay in the small chain ring & increase your<br>
HR by increasing your cadence.<br>
Maintain that intensity throughout this short effort<br>
Spin easily through the final 10:00, allowing your HR<br>
to gradually get below 60%<br>
RUN 0:35<br>
Easy reintroduction to running.<br>
Hold good running form<br>
throughout,<br>
and keep your upper body relaxed.<br>

        Wednesday<br>
Today's swim is a standard duration<br>
that we will incorporate into most Wednesday schedules. You can schedule<br>
this into your day as your situation allows (open swim schedules generally<br>
allow for morning swims, which is suggested). The bike effort should be<br>
done on your trainer, since it involves some drills and will incorporate<br>
very controlled workouts over time.<br>
<br>
SWIM 0:45<br>
WARM UP:<br>
6 x 150 w/10 sec rest after each -- each 150 is as follows:<br>
(50 Kick - 25 right<br>
arm only - 25 left arm only - 50 Swim)<br>
MAIN SET:<br>
2 x 600 w/30 sec rest in between<br>

Thursday's schedules will generally<br>
include a longer morning swim and a running session at the track later<br>
in the day. The track sessions won't be mandatory until later in the season,<br>
once we've established a sufficient aerobic base.<br>

SWIM 0:30<br>
WARM UP:<br>
200 Swim - 150 Kick - 150 Pull<br>

        Saturday<br>
Saturday's schedules will almost always<br>
include the longest cycling session of the week. This will be performed<br>
outdoors when it gets warmer (for those of us stuck in the colder climates,<br>
that is!). During the indoor riding season, these sessions can be shorter<br>
because they will also be more efficient -- no stopping for stop lights,<br>
very controllable terrain, etc. We will also begin to incorporate a short<br>
run after this ride once the weekly training durations get a bit longer.<br>
<br>
BIKE 1:20<br>
WARM UP:<br>
15:00 light spinning, gradually allowing your HR to<br>
get above 65%<br>
DRILLS: -- 1:00 recovery spinning after each<br>
alternate an ILT set with a VG set -- keep your HR under<br>
75% throughout:<br>
3 x 3:00 Isolated Leg Training:<br>
(20 sec right leg, 10 sec transition, 20 sec left leg,<br>
10 sec transition) -- 3 x thru<br>
3 x 4:30 Variable Gearing<br>
set:<br>
each set is done in the following way, twice through<br>
per set:<br>
45 sec in moderate gearing @90-95 rpm;<br>
45 sec in easy gearing @105+ rpm;<br>
45 sec in harder gearing @80-85 rpm<br>
20:00 steady time trial riding, holding your HR right<br>
at 75% throughout<br>
Cool down to the finish, allowing your HR to gradually<br>
come back below 60%. After performing the drills you should notice a smoother,<br>
more fluid pedal cycle.<br>

Sunday's focus is generally on the<br>
run; we incorporate an additional ride to increase the total aerobic effort<br>
while minimizing the stress on your legs. In the colder months, the run<br>
should always be performed first & the cycling shortly thereafter.<br>
<br>
RUN 0:55<br>
Steady endurance run, holding proper<br>
form and holding your HR under 75% the entire time. Think of this as<br>
an aerobic tempo run.<br>
BIKE 0:30<br>
Easy, continual spinning on your trainer, immediately<br>
following your run.<br>
You will probably begin this effort at a relatively<br>
high intensity, though you should hold your HR at or below 75% throughout.<br>
Be sure to allow 10-15:00 at the end for a long, gradual cool down, allowing<br>
your HR to get below 60% before you finish.<br>

Saturday's ride will always be the<br>
longest effort of the week. For those who can ride outdoors year-round,<br>
it is important to perform the warm up and drills on a regular basis during<br>
the pre-season period -- you can finish the ride outdoors if this option<br>
is available. In addition, there will be times when the main set will guide<br>
you to a more efficient, more effective workout. Use your judgment to ensure<br>
that you're getting the desired workout without unnecessary risk of injury<br>
or burnout.<br>

MAIN SET -- BIG TARGET!<br>
This target set is meant to be performed<br>
in an aerobic state, which means that you need to be disciplined and hold<br>
your HR intensity at or below 75% throughout the set. It is optimal to<br>
be able to measure the distance that you are riding in order to record<br>
your time for this test. If you are using a CompuTrainer,<br>
then just program the unit for a level course of 8.4 miles; if you are<br>
using another type of trainer (or riding out on the road), then use your<br>
cyclometer to measure the distance traveled.<br>
2 x 8.4 miles @75% w/3:00 @60% intensity in between<br>
-- make sure that you keep your HR under control for<br>
both repeats, and record both times (and average HR, if possible) for future<br>
reference.<br>

-- begin with 6:00 @60% in your easiest gear, then adjust<br>
to one gear harder for 5:00, then 4:00, 3:00, and finish with 2:00 @75%<br>
MAIN SET<br>
This main set should help demonstrate<br>
how much more smoothly you can pedal with some focus on spinning smooth<br>
circles. The target time trial distance is 11.2 miles (18.1km), which is<br>
exactly 1/10 of the Ironman ultra distance bike ride.<br>
2 x 3:00 ILT w/30 sec<br>
recovery after each<br>
Each one should be done as 6 x (20 sec one leg/10 sec<br>
transition), continuous<br>
1 x 11.2 miles (18.1 km) time trial @75% -- record your<br>
time<br>
2 x 3:00 ILT w/30 sec recovery after each -- right into<br>
1 x 11.2 miles (18.1 km) time trial @75% -- compare<br>
to the first time trial -- should be slightly faster at the same HR intensity<br>
2 x 3:00 ILT w/30 sec recovery after each -- your abs<br>
(stomach muscles) will probably be throbbing a bit here, but relax your<br>
mid-section and concentrate on smooth pedaling throughout the cycle<br>

RUN 1:10<br>
Begin with a 20:00 jog, getting into it very gradually,<br>
bringing the intensity up to 65% by the end.<br>
Big Target: 3-Mile MAF<br>
Test<br>
Here's the drill: Either perform this at a local track<br>
(preferably one you can run to), or use a familiar portion of a local course<br>
that you know to be roughly three miles in length. Begin by gradually increasing<br>
your HR up to 75% intensity -- beginning this directly after the warm up<br>
would work best -- and then, when you are at a known starting point, start<br>
your watch!<br>
Be sure to hold your HR right at 75% throughout the<br>
test run -- no more! -- and stop your watch after reaching the three-mile<br>
point. Record your time for future comparison.<br>
Be sure to cool down completely, immediately after your<br>
run. Your HR should be at or under 60% before you come to a close.<br>
BIKE 0:50<br>
This bike ride can be done indoors or outside, making<br>
sure to hold the intensity level in the aerobic zone throughout (60-70%<br>
intensity). For those inside, we can do a "mini-MAF" test here as well,<br>
after a 20:00 warm up spin:<br>
2 x 3.1 miles (5 km) @75% intensity w/3:00 @60% recovery<br>
after each<br>
-- record your times for future comparison, again remaining<br>
careful to keep the intensity below 75% at all times.<br>
Cool down completely, bringing your HR down to 60% by<br>
the end.<br>

RUN 1:20<br>
Straight endurance run -- since this is the end of a<br>
long, difficult week, it's important to hold your HR under control during<br>
today's longer run. Hold the intensity below 70% as long as you can, and<br>
don't let your HR get above 75%, even if you have to walk.<br>
BIKE 0:35<br>
This short recovery spin should be done immediately<br>
after your run to aid in recovery. Keep the intensity under 70% throughout,<br>

DRILLS<br>
3 x 4:30 VG Set w/30 sec<br>

40 sec in medium gear, @100 rpm;<br>
20 sec in easy gear, @110-115 rpm;<br>
30 sec in hard gear, @90 rpm<br>
MAIN SET<br>
Straight (6.2mi / 10km / 20:00) time trial @75% intensity<br>
It should be relatively easy to hold your<br>
HR right at this intensity level, holding your cadence at roughly 90 rpm<br>
throughout.<br>
3 x (1.0mi / 1.5 km / 3:00) @84% w/30 sec recovery after<br>
each<br>
Repeat the (6.2mi / 10km / 20:00) time trial @75% intensity<br>
After the moderately hard speed set your<br>
body will likely be "shocked" into a higher HR with the higher levels of<br>
lactate, due to the higher amount of oxygen required to process this waste<br>
product. Be sure to hold your HR UNDER 75% on this second effort -- this<br>
will help demonstrate the adjustments that your body makes when you push<br>
it harder in the midst of a longer aerobic effort.<br>
3 x (1.0mi / 1.5 km / 3:00) @84% w/30 sec recovery after<br>
each<br>
This will simulate a higher intensity<br>
finish to a longer effort.<br>
COOL DOWN completely, gradually reducing your gearing<br>
(holding your cadence @90 rpm) until your HR is about 10 beats lower than<br>
the 60% intensity level -- continue pedaling at a reduced cadence (80-85<br>
rpm) until your HR is closer to 50%.<br>

it there for the first 40:00. Then include the following:<br>
3 x 3:00 @75% (80-85 SPM)<br>
w/7:00 @70% after each<br>
Cool down a bit after your run, but you should complete<br>
your cool down by cycling immediately after your run:<br>
BIKE 0:40<br>
Hold your HR near 75% during the transition from running<br>
to cycling; you should be experiencing some familiar "heaviness" as the<br>
blood concentration changes to different areas of your large leg muscles.<br>
Continue spinning, holding your cadence @90 rpm; cool<br>
down the last 10:00, allowing your HR to gradually come back down below<br>
60%, and closer to 50%, by the end...Great week!<br>

15:00 total spinning, using a gearing<br>

- 6:00 @70%<br>
MAIN SET<br>
This is an extended aerobic set, meant<br>
to boost your aerobic endurance with minimal break-down. Monitor your HR<br>
carefully and stick to the suggested intensity guidelines.<br>
5 x 7:30 @75% w/1:30 recovery between 60-70%<br>
COOL DOWN<br>
Begin your cool down with the final recovery spin in<br>
the main set, and gently bring your HR back down to 60% or under before<br>
finishing the session.<br>
RUN 0:35<br>
Follow some structure here, both for variety<br>
and to maintain focus on aerobic conditioning.<br>
10:00 warm up, beginning with very light jogging &<br>
gradually building your HR up to 60-70% by the end<br>
This set will help you work on increasing<br>
your foot speed, without letting your HR get any higher than 75%. We'll<br>
do this by counting strides -- remember, two steps = one stride<br>
-- rather than timing the intervals:<br>
4 x 250 strides (should be around 3:00-3:30) @75% w/2:00<br>
relaxed jogging after each<br>
Good job! Now, bring the intensity back down gradually,<br>
all the way down to 60%. It would be great to add an additional 3-4:00<br>
of walking afterwards to bring your HR back down to 100 bpm by the end.<br>

aerobic state. This takes some discipline ("But Coach, I can't slow down!"),<br>
but it is necessary to improve your aerobic efficiency while avoiding any<br>
overtraining.<br>
<br>
BIKE 1:50<br>
WARM UP<br>
10:00 easy spin, bringing your HR up to 70% by the end<br>
DRILLS<br>
2 x 3:00 Variable Gearing<br>
Set w/30 sec recovery after each<br>
-- each set should be done as follows:<br>
2 x (40 sec in medium gear, 20 sec in easiest gear,<br>
30 sec in hardest gear)<br>
MAIN SET -- BIG TARGET!<br>
This is designed to provide you with an<br>
uninterrupted, high quality aerobic ride. Performing this indoors will<br>
help you work very efficiently: No changes in the terrain, no traffic lights<br>
or cars to contend with, etc. Of course, there's also little or no scenery,<br>
and you'll have to provide your own fresh air -- but discipline here will<br>
continue to pay dividends going forward.<br>
2 x (11.2 miles / 18km) @75% w/2:00 recovery @60-70%<br>
intensity<br>
-- make sure that you keep your HR under control for<br>
both repeats, and record both times (and average HR, if possible) for future<br>
reference.<br>
(Use 33:00 as an interval time if you don't have access<br>
to a cyclometer.)<br>
COOL DOWN<br>
Spin through a "reverse gearing pyramid" (14:00 total):<br>
5:00 @75-70% - 4:00 @70-65% - 3:00 @65-60% - 2:00 under<br>
60%<br>
RUN 0:30<br>
If you can, put this run in immediately after the bike<br>
session. However, DO NOT run outside if it's cold out! If you don't have<br>
access to a tread mill, then wait until later in the day to fit this in.<br>
Make sure you do, though, as it is an excellent aerobic extension to your<br>
earlier ride.<br>

RUN 1:15<br>
Long, steady distance run. It should be easier to control<br>
your HR than it was earlier in the season, and you should hold your intensity<br>
level right at 70% for the bulk of this effort. You should definitely keep<br>
the intensity below 75% at all times.<br>
BIKE 0:40<br>
This is a recuperative effort, so just spin easy, breathing<br>
deeply and allowing your legs to flush out the lactic acid that has built<br>
up recently. Drink plenty of water during this ride and during the remainder<br>
of the day.<br>

This is one of the longest (perhaps<br>
the longest) cycling sessions we've had so far -- if you<br>
try to swallow it all at once you'll choke, so bear with me and let's take<br>
it through one segment at a time....<br>
<br>
BIKE 2:15<br>
WARM UP<br>
20:00 Gearing Pyramid,<br>
as follows:<br>
2:00 in easiest gear (hold 90 rpm), 3:00 in next hardest<br>
gear, 4:00 in next,<br>
then 5:00, and finally 6:00 @85-90rpm<br>
DRILLS<br>
3 x 3:00 ILT w/30 sec<br>
recovery spinning in between<br>
- each ILT interval should be 6 x (20 sec one leg /<br>
10 sec transition)<br>
INTERMEDIATE<br>
SET<br>
Alternate fast spinning (110+ rpm) with easy pedaling<br>
(90 rpm or less) as follows:<br>
15 sec fast/15 sec easy; 30 sec fast/30 easy; 45 fast/45<br>
easy<br>
1:00 easy spin before starting the main set<br>
(You should be at the 40:00 mark or so by now)<br>
MAIN SET -- BIG TARGET!<br>
Stick with mileage, unless you go way<br>
over the target time; if you do, then adjust the target mileage down such<br>
that you can finish the interval in the recommended amount of time.<br>
2 x (33:00 / 11.2mi / 18km) @75% w/2:00 recovery, between<br>
60-70%<br>
finish with 1 x (15:00 / 5mi / 8km)<br>
- Record your time & average HR for each, as well<br>
as your average power output (if you have a CompuTrainer) for future analysis.<br>
You might want to have a pen & paper handy before you start this!<br>
COOL DOWN<br>
10:00 easy spinning, bringing your HR back down under<br>
60% before stopping<br>
RUN 0:40<br>
This is an extension of today's endurance work, so start<br>
it as soon after the cycling as you can. If you start right after biking,<br>
then it should be pretty easy to get your HR up above 70%; in any case,<br>
keep your HR under 75% throughout the run.<br>

RUN 1:30<br>
You'll want to do this session at the<br>
same place you did the last time (January 5), either on the road or at<br>
the track. It's important to be as consistent as possible (run at the same<br>
place, the same time of day) to enable you to measure your progress accurately.<br>
Warm up with a 10:00 jog, bringing your HR to 60-65%<br>
Intermediate Set:<br>
4 x 15 sec @75% (faster foot speed) w/45 sec recovery<br>
jog after each<br>
Your HR should be up around 75% and ready to go!<br>
Big Target: 3-Mile (5 km) MAF<br>
Test<br>
Be sure to hold your HR right at 75% throughout the<br>
test run -- no more! -- and stop your watch after reaching the three-mile<br>
point. Record your time for future comparison -- you should see some improvement<br>
over the last time (perhaps 5-10 sec per mile)<br>
Continue with a 30:00 endurance run @70%, either at<br>
the track or out on the road. This will add additional aerobic work to<br>
today's longer effort. Be sure to cool down completely, walking the final<br>
2-3:00 to get your HR under 50% before stopping.<br>
BIKE 0:50<br>
This is the "finale" to your longest week so far...congrats!<br>
Spin easily, and don't do anything that might jack your HR up above 75%.<br>
The purpose of this ride is to begin your recuperation before next week's<br>
challenges, so don't skimp on this...and get ready for next week!<br>

DAILY TOTAL: 1:40<br>
WEEK-TO-DATE: 6:05<br>
Friday<br>
In this higher intensity week, this<br>
day off is absolutely essential. You should have been controlling your<br>
stress throughout the week, concentrating on getting enough sleep and hydrating<br>
properly. This day off should help you catch up with your recuperation<br>
after the big target sessions over the past two days. Relax & enjoy! <br>
Saturday<br>
<br>
BIKE 1:45<br>
This is another workout that was brought<br>
forward from four weeks ago. There was some feedback that the last cycle<br>
might have introduced too much intensity, too early on; repeating key workouts<br>
four weeks later should give you a solid sense of accomplishment in your<br>
continual improvement.<br>
WARM UP<br>
15:00 controlled spin: 4:00 @60%, 5:00 @65%, 6:00 @70%<br>
Aerobic Set:<br>
This is designed to add some aerobic "bulk"<br>
to today's session -- do it at the suggested intensities, and get ready<br>
for the main set.<br>
2 x (20:00 / 6.2mi / 10km) @75% w/2:00 @60% recovery<br>
after each<br>
Intermediate Set:<br>
During this set your HR intensity should<br>
bridge the gap from 75% up to 84%, getting your body ready for some higher<br>
quality, high intensity work.<br>
4 x 20 sec fast spinning (120 rpm) w/40 sec recovery<br>
spinning (90 rpm) after each - continuous<br>
MAIN SET -- BIG TARGET<br>
This set is described in terms of time;<br>
if you have a CompuTrainer, or if your cyclometer is driven off your rear<br>
wheel, then you can substitute the distances (in parenthesis below) for<br>
the time. Be sure to record your times and average HR's for future comparisons.<br>
- You should definitely notice some significant<br>
improvement over the past four weeks--take good notes!<br>
3 x (8:30 / 3.1mi / 5km) time trial @84% w/2:30 recovery<br>
btwn 60-70%<br>
COOL DOWN<br>
Continuous spinning until your HR is back under 60%.<br>
Adjust your gearing such that your cadence remains at roughly 90 rpm through<br>
the end of the session. Good job!<br>

RUN 1:20<br>
Steady aerobic effort, keeping your HR under 75% the<br>
entire time. Be sure to keep the intensity under control -- too much higher<br>
intensity efforts during a tough week like this one, and you could be inviting<br>
some physical breakdown...<br>
BIKE 0:40<br>
Make sure to fit this in today, right after today's<br>
run if possible. This is especially beneficial after a harder week such<br>
as this one, and should give you some time to gather your thought on your<br>
accomplishments over the past several days -- great job!<br>

Sure, this is a long workout. Of course,<br>
it's less than half the time you'll be riding in your big Ironman-distance<br>
race later this year! Yeah, yeah, yeah, that'll be outside, full of volunteers,<br>
and exciting...but you've got to do it now, to do it right then. Have a<br>
good time with it!<br>
WARM UP<br>
20:00 warm up spin, easing into your long ride by slowly<br>
bringing your intensity up to 70%<br>

MAIN SET -- BIG TARGET!<br>
This is a longer big target set, and will<br>
be used to track your aerobic conditioning at this point. This "Descending<br>
Ironman" set adds up to exactly 25% of the overall Ironman distance.<br>
Start your watch at the beginning of your first interval,<br>
and check your split times at the end of each segment. Your HR should be<br>
constant @75% during the intervals, and can drop to 60% (no lower) during<br>
the recovery periods.<br>
(11.2 miles / 18km / 33:00) @75% -- recover to 36 min<br>
mark @60%<br>
(8.4 miles / 13.5km / 24:00) @75% -- recover to 1:03<br>
mark @60%<br>
(5.6 miles / 9km / 16:30) @75% -- recover to 1:21 mark<br>
@60%<br>
(2.8 miles / 4.5km / 9:00) @75% -- recover to 1:35 mark<br>
@60%<br>
COOL DOWN<br>
Continue spinning @70-75% until the 2:40 mark (about<br>
15:00)<br>
RUN 0:45<br>
Transition quickly to your running gear and begin running<br>
as soon as possible. You should be able to quickly bring your HR up to<br>
75% -- hold it there for the bulk of this run (either inside, if it's freezing<br>
out, or on a treadmill). You should ease down your intensity level to 60%<br>
at the end, with an additional few minutes of walking to bring your day<br>
to closure. Great job!<br>

RUN 1:40<br>
It's been four weeks since your last aerobic<br>
running test, which makes it the perfect time to measure your progress.<br>
In addition to gauging your relative aerobic fitness, these "test runs"<br>
also give you an opportunity to test any new pre-race preparations (eating/drinking<br>
strategies) as well as any new equipment. Have fun with it & enjoy<br>
the challenge!<br>
WARM UP<br>
20 min. warm up jog, gradually getting your HR up to<br>
60% & holding it between 60-70% throughout.<br>
INTERMEDIATE SET<br>
4 x 30 sec @75% w/60 sec @60-70% after each<br>
Your HR should now be settled in near 75% and ready<br>
for the test:<br>
Big Target: 4-Mile (6.5 km) MAF<br>
Test<br>
You'll notice that the distance for this big target<br>
has been slightly increased since the last one, and we will be gradually<br>
building this up to 6 miles (10km) over the next few months to better test<br>
your aerobic strength over longer distances. Be sure to hold your HR right<br>
at 75% throughout the test run -- no more! -- and make sure to record your<br>
time.<br>
Continue with a 40 min. endurance run @70%, either at<br>
the track or out on the road. This will add additional aerobic work to<br>
today's longer effort. Be sure to cool down completely, walking the final<br>
2-3:00 to get your HR under 50% before stopping.<br>
BIKE 1:00<br>
This is a continuation of your run, designed<br>
to extend the aerobic benefit while relieving your legs from the run's<br>
pounding stress. Begin as soon after the run as possible.<br>
10:00 warm up spin<br>
2 x (6.2mi / 10km / 18:00) @75% w/2:00 recovery after<br>

Steady aerobic effort, making sure to hold proper<br>
running form. Keep your HR under 75% the entire time.<br>
BIKE 0:45<br>
Easy spin, just a rejuvenating continuation of your<br>
run. Don't let your HR get above 70%, and bring it down gradually to 60%<br>
with 5:00 remaining. Finish with 2-3 min @50% or slightly below.<br>
Here's some structure that can help pass the time:<br>
Begin with 25:00 @75%, in a fairly challenging gear<br>
-- you should start out with a cadence of 80-84, and as your legs adjust<br>
to the transition from the run this will naturally increase to the mid-90's<br>
(if it doesn't, switch to an easier gear).<br>
Reduce the gearing for the next 12:30, holding 60-70%,<br>
and finish up with 7:30 of easy spinning @50-60%.<br>

Today's main set is the same distance<br>
as the previous target set (Feb 19), except today's is broken into smaller<br>
pieces (100s vs. 150s). You should therefore be capable of going at least<br>
1-2 sec per 100 faster than you did two weeks ago. Progression is key,<br>
and you should start seeing some significant progress at this time.<br>

This set is described in terms of time;<br>
if you have a CompuTrainer, or if your cyclometer is driven off your rear<br>
wheel, then you can substitute the distances (in parenthesis below) for<br>
the time. Be sure to record your times and average HR's for future comparisons.<br>

This is the end of a particularly<br>
hard week, and you've successfully gotten through the longest, toughest<br>
cycle so far -- terrific! Of course, there are significant challenges ahead,<br>
both before and during the upcoming race season, so let's use your success<br>
so far to inspire you to produce even better results going forward! Good<br>
job this week!<br>
<br>
RUN 1:30<br>
This low-intensity aerobic work at the end of a tough<br>
week is very important to initiate the recovery process. Don't look at<br>
this as another opportunity to go beat your brains out -- we've done enough<br>
of that already! Keep your HR under 75%, avoid any big-time hills (save<br>
them for later!), and relax.<br>
BIKE 0:45<br>
Spin out after your run, flushing your legs out with<br>
fresh blood. The intensity level here should stay close to 60%, and you<br>
need to hydrate like crazy after your run to improve your body's recovery<br>
process. Drink up!<br>

attitude fresh. Just make sure to keep your HR under 75% (and closer to<br>
70%) the entire time.<br>
BIKE 0:45<br>
This is the usual continuation of the morning's aerobic<br>
running effort. The reason for putting the short bike work *after* the<br>
run is to enable you to continue the effort & cool down more completely<br>

BIKE 0:55<br>
Easy spin, just a rejuvenating continuation of your<br>
run. Don't let your HR get above 70%, and bring it down gradually to 60%<br>
with 5:00 remaining. Finish with 2-3 min @50% or slightly below.<br>
Here's some structure that can help pass the time:<br>
Begin with 30:00 @75%, in a fairly challenging gear<br>
-- you should start out with a cadence of 80-84, and as your legs adjust<br>
to the transition from the run this will naturally increase to the mid-90's<br>
(if it doesn't, switch to an easier gear).<br>
Reduce the gearing for the next 15:00, holding 60-70%,<br>
and finish up with 10:00 of easy spinning @50-60%.<br>

15:00 jog, gradually increase your HR to 70% the last<br>
several minutes<br>
INTERMEDIATE SET<br>
6 x 30 sec build up to 90% (relaxed speed) w/60 sec<br>
@60-70% after each<br>
-- if at a track, build up the straights and jog the<br>
curves<br>
-- make sure legs feel loosened up before you do the<br>
main set.<br>
Your HR should now be settled in near 75% and ready<br>
for the test. Take a couple minutes to prepare yourself before doing the<br>
main set:<br>
Big Target: 2 x (2.5mi / 4000m) hold @75% MAF<br>
Test<br>
-- jog for 3:00 between repeats<br>
-- see how even your two repeats are. The better shape<br>
you are in, the closer they will be. This will be a good comparison test<br>
to do later in the summer.<br>
Continue running at an aerobic pace -- less than 75%<br>
intensity -- through your cool down; reduce the intensity gradually to<br>
under 50% by the end.<br>
BIKE 1:05<br>
Begin this low intensity spin immediately afterwards,<br>
beginning @75% for 30:00, slowly reducing your gearing to hold a 90 rpm<br>
as you bring the intensity down to<br>
70% for 20:00, then<br>
65% for 10:00, finishing with<br>
60% and below for the final 5:00.<br>

No run following today's ride -- nothing<br>
to save up for, so let's do it!<br>
WARM UP<br>
20:00 warm up spin, using a gearing<br>
pyramid to get into it slowly.<br>
Aerobic Set:<br>
This is designed to add some aerobic "bulk"<br>
to today's session -- do it at the suggested intensities, and get ready<br>
for the main set.<br>
4 x 8:00 @75% with 2:00 @60% recovery<br>
MAIN SET -- BIG TARGET<br>
This set is described in terms of time;<br>
if you have a CompuTrainer, or if your cyclometer is driven off your rear<br>
wheel, then you can substitute the distances (in parenthesis below) for<br>
the time. Be sure to record your times and average HR's for future comparisons.<br>
This set is a little tougher than last<br>
time around (March 8), but not too different in nature. It's time to start<br>
preparing your body for the efforts you'll have to put forth during the<br>
Competitive Season.<br>
2 x (5.0mi / 8km / 15:00) time trial @75% w/1:00 recovery<br>
btwn 60-70%<br>
Intermediate Set:<br>
During this set your HR intensity should<br>
bridge the gap from 75% up to 84%, getting your body ready for some higher<br>
quality, high intensity work.<br>
4 x 20 sec fast spinning (120 rpm) w/40 sec recovery<br>
spinning (90 rpm) after each - continuous<br>
2 x (5.0mi / 8km / 13:30) time trial @84% w/2:30 recovery<br>
btwn 60-70%<br>
COOL DOWN<br>
Continuous spinning until your HR is back under 60%.<br>
Adjust your gearing such that your cadence remains at roughly 90 rpm through<br>
the end of the session. That's it for today -- Great job!<br>

Hopefully you've been handling the<br>
increase in hours and intensity thus far. Hard workouts will soon take<br>
on a much more anaerobic flavor for the most part. Get psyched to get fast!<br>
<br>
RUN 1:40<br>
Total aerobic effort. Be sure to keep your HR below<br>
70%. This should feel more like a recovery run than an aerobic workout.<br>
Go as easy as you need to in order to accomplish this. Remember, if you<br>
feel beat after a recovery session, then you went too hard or too long.<br>
BIKE 0:50<br>
Spin out after your run, flushing your legs out with<br>
fresh blood. The intensity level here should be at 50-60% and your RPMs<br>

BIKE 0:55<br>
Spin @65% effort and 90-95 rpm, immediately after the<br>
run if possible.<br>
This is more "bulk" aerobic work designed to add some<br>

INTERMEDIATE<br>
SET<br>
2 sets of:<br>
4 x (20 sec spin @110+ rpm/40 sec easy spin @85-90 rpm)<br>
-- spin easy for 2:00 between sets (keep your HR between<br>
60-70%)<br>
MAIN SET<br>
This classic "AT" (anaerobic threshold)<br>
set is designed to test your ability to hold a steady, controlled pace<br>
for a longer period of time. The idea is to use the first few repeats (3<br>
or 4) to raise your HR up to about 80%, then hold this "steady state" for<br>
the duration of the set. Your HR will naturally rise throughout the set,<br>
so just concentrate on keeping it below 85% -- any higher and you'll probably<br>
have to stop before the set is finished.<br>
16 x (1.2mi / 2km / 3:30) @80-85% w/30 sec recovery<br>
spin after each<br>
-- hold your HR above 75% during the recovery period<br>

MAIN SET<br>
Make sure that you maintain an even pace<br>
throughout this set. Also, keep jogging through the recovery, never letting<br>
your HR get below 65% (staying aerobic) -- the idea is to continue this<br>
as if it were one long, evenly paced tempo<br>
run.<br>

BIKE 3:25<br>
Use the duration as a guide if you are<br>
riding outside -- the indoor alternative shown here is shorter (around<br>
3:00), but will be more efficient and focused than riding outdoors. The<br>
tradeoff, of course, is that you'll miss the bike handling development,<br>
fresh air, and general excitement that comes from a long ride. Either way,<br>
you win!<br>
WARM UP<br>
20:00 gearing pyramid<br>
-- 2:00, 3, 4, 5, & 6:00 intervals, increasing your<br>

MAIN SET -- BIG TARGET!<br>
These progressive sets begin with aerobic<br>
intervals, then increases intensities as the distances decrease. Pace yourself<br>
through the entire 55km, and record your results for future reference.<br>
CompuTrainer Alternative: You can, instead of<br>
this first set (2 x 20km), simply do the pre-programmed Columbia Triathlon<br>
course. Be sure to pace yourself through that as you would this set and<br>
be sure to record your results for future comparison.<br>

RUN 2:00<br>
It's time for another MAF<br>
test to check out your aerobic condition. Record your results of this<br>
main set for future comparison -- you should be seeing steady improvement<br>
as your overall fitness improves.<br>
WARM UP<br>
15:00 jog, gradually increase your HR to 70% the last<br>
several minutes -- continue into a<br>
30:00 aerobic run, ending up at the track<br>
INTERMEDIATE SET<br>
6 x 20 sec build up to 90% (relaxed speed) w/60 sec<br>
@60-70% after each<br>
-- if at a track, build up the straights and jog the<br>
curves<br>
-- make sure legs feel loosened up before you do the<br>
main set.<br>
Your HR should now be settled in near 75% and ready<br>
for the test. Take a couple minutes to prepare yourself before doing the<br>
main set:<br>
Big Target (7mi / 11.2km total, including recovery):<br>
4 x (2400m / 1.5mi) right @75% w/400m @65-70% after<br>
each<br>
-- the entire set will provide aerobic work, and breaking<br>
this into intervals will enable you to focus on holding good form while<br>
keeping your HR under control<br>
Go straight through into your cool down, beginning @75%<br>
and reducing the intensity gradually to under 50% by the end.<br>
BIKE 1:15<br>
This ride can be done either indoors or<br>
outside (be careful not to get caught outside in chilly weather -- up north<br>
anyway!). If you're inside, then here's some basic structure to follow:<br>
25:00 spin<br>
It's always a struggle to get your "riding legs" back<br>
after a hard run, so don't be surprised if you're going relatively slow<br>
at first. Your blood will get redistributed quickly, bringing oxygen and<br>
"freeing up" the other large muscles in your legs used for riding.<br>
4 x (2.5mi / 4km / 7:30) @75% w/2:30 @60-70% after each<br>
Wind it down the last 10:00, finishing with your HR<br>
back under 60%.<br>

BIKE 2:50<br>
It's difficult to develop an indoor cycling<br>
workout that approaches three hours in length without stetching the bounds<br>
of your sanity! Go ahead and perform this ride outdoors if possible, and<br>
follow this slightly reduced duration ride if you're stuck indoors. The<br>
increased efficiency when riding on a trainer will make up for the reduced<br>
"saddle time".<br>
WARM UP<br>
20:00 Gearing Pyramid:<br>
-- 3:00 getting to 50%, 4:00 up to 60%, 5:00 @60-70%,<br>
8:00 @70%<br>
DRILLS<br>
These ILT drills are an excellent mechanism<br>
for balancing your pedal stroke -- I do them regularly, and it's really<br>
helped me get my cycling "feel" back quickly. Even if you're riding outside<br>
these days (a good idea), you should take some time before or after your<br>
ride to include this drill.<br>
3 x 3:00 ILT w/30 sec<br>

3 x (20 sec one leg / 10 sec transition / 20 sec other<br>

-- straight into:<br>
2 x (6.2 miles / 10km / 17:30) @80% w/2:30 recovery<br>
@60-70% in between<br>
COOL DOWN<br>
Continue spinning for at least 20:00 @60-70% -- you're<br>
deriving some<br>
aerobic benefit as long as you're above 60% -- then<br>
bring your HR<br>
back under 60% before finishing. Hold your cadence at<br>
90+ rpm<br>
throughout, though you can bring it under 85rpm for<br>
the final few minutes.<br>
RUN 0:40<br>
This is a steady aerobic effort to finish off your day<br>
-- do a quick transition after your ride and get on the run right away.<br>
Keep your HR under 75% throughout, and finish with 2-3:00 of walking to<br>
bring the intensity under 50% before stopping.<br>

Right after your run, either indoors or out on the road<br>
(be careful if it's chilly outside -- stay indoors!). Hold your intensity<br>
between 60-70%, and maintain a cadence of 85-90rpm. Stay in your small<br>
chain ring to reduce stress and improve your recovery.<br>

Give yourself about 20:00 to get into it, letting your<br>
HR rise gradually to 65-70%<br>
30:00 tempo run --<br>
challenge yourself here: it should feel pretty tough, but definitely short<br>
of that '"race pace" tightness and exhaustion. Your HR should stay above<br>
80%, but should also remain below 85% throughout the effort.<br>
Cool down completely, allowing your HR to come down<br>
gradually. It's important that you recuperate properly to leave yourself<br>
ready to attack the remainder of the week.<br>

MAIN SET -- BIG TARGET!<br>
Today's big target is the same duration<br>
as the previous ones, but the durations are mixed up to provide some variety<br>
and to help you keep your focus throughout the set.<br>
4 sets of the following, all at race pace (85+%):<br>
200 w/20 sec rest<br>
2 x 100 w/10 sec rest<br>

2 x (400m / 1:30) @85% w/(100m / 30 sec) recovery<br>
-- extra (800m / 4:00) recovery jog after each set<br>
-- these "broken miles" should add up to your Half-Marathon<br>
PR pace per mile, or better!<br>
Long cool down jog, continuing to run until your HR<br>
returns under 75%, then 70%, then 65%. You should walk the final 2-3:00<br>
to ensure that your HR is back under 100bpm before stopping.<br>

During this set your HR intensity should<br>
bridge the gap from 75% up to 84%, getting your body ready for some higher<br>
quality, high intensity work.<br>

First day of serious interval work geared<br>
towrard racing. We're following a program we call the Aussie<br>
Bike Plan that Nate followed with great success back in 1994 &<br>

INTERMEDIATE<br>
SET<br>
5 x 20 sec relaxed "bursts" of speed w/1:40 easy @100rpm<br>

MAIN SET - BIG TARGET!<br>
You can substitute a pre-determined distance<br>
rather than the designated time interval to help you gauge your future<br>
progress. Focus on getting your HR into the suggested intensity zone and<br>
holding it there during these tough intervals. This first set in the program<br>
is designed to tax your Anaerobic Threshold (AT) energy system.<br>
CompuTrainer users: Program<br>
a course that you can cover in the designated time period; you also might<br>
find it easier to achieve these higher HR intensities if you include some<br>
sections where the grade is slightly uphill, such as +0.4-0.7%. Just be<br>
careful not to overstress your knees!<br>

DRILLS<br>
4 x 3:00 Isolated Leg Training<br>

1 x (11.2mi / 33:00) @70-75% w/5:00 @60-65% / 90rpm<br>

Continue spinning @90rpm for at least 15:00, bringing<br>
your HR back under 60%, then 50% before finishing. (2:15-2:30 total)<br>
RUN 0:40<br>
Very quick transition and blast out the<br>
door at 10K pace for the first 5:00 before settling down to 75% for the<br>
next 25:00. Cool down below 60% for the final 10:00<br>

DRILLS<br>
4 x 4:30 Variable Gearing<br>
set w/30 sec recovery<br>
-- every repeat should be as follows:<br>
3 x thru the following:<br>
40 sec in "medium" gear;<br>
20 sec in "easy" gear;<br>
30 sec in "hard" gear<br>
Continue spinning @75% to the end, before hopping off<br>
your bike & into a quick transition to your run gear.<br>
RUN 1:50<br>
This is a controlled aerobic effort, as<br>
follows:<br>
15:00 getting loose, getting your HR up to 60, and then<br>
70%.<br>
You don't want to go higher than this during your long<br>
weekend runs -- we need to differentiate between harder aerobic runs at<br>
75% and lower intensity LSD efforts below 70%.<br>
Hold your HR at or below 70% for the next 1:00, concentrating<br>
on keeping your body relaxed and staying light on your feet. Hold your<br>
stride count to 90-95 spm when the terrain<br>
allows.<br>
At the 1:20 mark, push the intensity up to 75-84% for<br>
20:00<br>

BIKE 1:20<br>
This is the first workout in the second<br>
week following the Aussie Bike Plan. If you're<br>
using consistent distances over time, you can record and analyze your progress<br>
weekly.<br>
Give yourself about 10:00 to get into it, letting your<br>
HR rise gradually to 65-70%<br>
INTERMEDIATE<br>
SET<br>
4 x 20 sec relaxed "bursts" of speed w/40 sec easy @100rpm<br>
after each<br>
MAIN SET - BIG TARGET!<br>
You can substitute a pre-determined distance<br>
rather than the designated time interval to help you gauge your future<br>
progress. By focusing on the 84-92% intensity zone, this set is designed<br>
to tax your Anaerobic Threshold (AT) energy system.<br>
CompuTrainer users: Remember<br>
that you should find it easier to achieve these higher HR intensities if<br>
you include some sections where the grade is slightly uphill (+0.4-0.7%).<br>
Keep the course the same from week-to-week for comparison, and be careful<br>
not to overstress your knees!<br>

2 x (6.2mi / 10km / 18:30) @75% w/1:30 @60-65% after<br>
each<br>
This drill will help recruit different<br>
types of muscle fibres<br>
and act as an intermediate set as well:<br>
4 x 4:30 Variable Gearing<br>
set w/30 sec recovery<br>
-- every repeat should be as follows:<br>
3 x thru the following:<br>

Continue spinning @90rpm, bringing your HR back under<br>
60%, then 50% before finishing.<br>
RUN 0:50<br>
This week we'll go straight outside and bump up the<br>
intensity right away. Spend the first 5:00 @80-85%,<br>
simulating the feeling of getting out of the transition<br>
area.<br>
Then bring the intensity back down to 75% for the duration.<br>

MAIN SET<br>
Don't worry about getting your HR into<br>
this higher zone right away -- use the first repeat to bring your HR up<br>
above 84% (should take about 8-10:00), and then press the intensity up<br>
closer to 92% by the end. It will be easier to elevate your HR above 84%<br>
on the second repeat, and you should be closer to 92% for the final 6-8:00<br>
of the set.<br>

as though they were a triathlon -- without the entry fee! In fact, feel<br>
free to put the swim in first (if pool time permits), then transition quickly<br>
to your bike, and finish off with the run. Of course there won't be any<br>
aid stations, but you can't have everything....<br>

Aerobic Intervals:<br>
Each of these intervals is equal to 1/10th<br>

a steady, sustainable pace.<br>
2 x (11.2mi / 33:00) @75% w/3:00 @60-70% recovery in<br>
between<br>
Intermediate Set:<br>
During this set your HR intensity should<br>
bridge the gap from 75% up to 84%, getting your body ready for some higher<br>
quality, high intensity work.<br>
4 x 20 sec faster spinning (110+ rpm) w/40 sec recovery<br>
spinning (90 rpm) after each - continuous<br>

You can put this first in your day or<br>
last -- in either case, get into it slowly. If you're doing this first-thing<br>
then finish hard; if you're finishing up your day then use it as additional<br>
recovery time, holding your intensity under 65% throughout.<br>

As with last week, use the first repeat<br>
to get yourself into that higher intensity AT zone -- this should take<br>
less time than it did last week, but will still probably require 6-8:00<br>
of steady riding. Be patient and pace yourself wisely -- remember, there's<br>
a second repeat coming up! You should be recording your times, average<br>
HR (if possible) and average mph/kph (or average time per mile/km), and<br>
you should definitely begin to notice some improvements over time.<br>

4 x In & Out repeats<br>
(100 / 20 sec)<br>
This set contains a larger number of smaller<br>
repeats -- the idea is to retain good running<br>
form in short bursts, and keeping your HR in the desired intensity<br>
range throughout the set. Get psyched and go get 'em!<br>
You'll notice that it will take 2-3 repeats<br>
to elevate your HR to the desired zone, but this is exactly what you experience<br>
in a "straight" road race. Pace yourself accordingly, elevate your HR into<br>
the desired zone in a controlled fashion, and keep it up throughout this<br>

BIKE 3:25<br>
Rides of this duration should definitely<br>
be done outside, and you should begin to develop a fueling strategy that<br>
you can become confident with later on in the summer. If necessary, feel<br>
free to break this ride up into more than one "loop", with each ending<br>
at your own personal "aid station".<br>
If you're stuck inside due to bad weather,<br>
you can either switch this ride with tomorrow's run, or do the following<br>
indoor alternative:<br>

each<br>
Intermediate Set:<br>
During this set your HR intensity should<br>
bridge the gap from 75% up to 84%, getting your body ready for some higher<br>
quality, high intensity work.<br>
4 x 20 sec faster spinning (110+ rpm) w/40 sec recovery<br>

Continue spinning at least 15:00 @90rpm, bringing your<br>
HR back under 60%, then 50% for at least 5:00 before finishing.<br>
(Total time is just under 3:00)<br>
RUN 0:50<br>
Put in a fast transition and get on the road right away.<br>
Your HR should be elevated above 75% quickly -- just keep it below 85%.<br>
Hold it in this range for the first 30:00, then cool down completely by<br>
the end.<br>
SWIM 0:30<br>

MAIN SET<br>
We're going to play around with this set<br>
a bit, asking your legs to recruit different muscle fibres by adjusting<br>
your cadence in the middle of each repeat. Forcing this adjustment serves<br>
two purposes: it simulates real riding more closely, and it helps promote<br>
pedaling efficiency. It's tougher, for sure -- have fun with it!<br>
2 x 10:00 @84-92% w/10:00 @60-70% after each<br>
each 10:00 repeat should be done as follows:<br>
- 2:00 @85-90 rpm (hard gear)<br>
here's where you adjust your gearing (6:00 total)<br>

        Sunday.<br>
The idea is to offer your body a solid<br>
idea of what an extended duration of activity feels like. Ideally these<br>
kinds of weekends will begin with a ride that will help you test your fueling<br>
strategies (you should stop as little as possible), and finish with a run<br>
that puts you solidly in the aerobic zone for an extended period of time.<br>
In future training cycles this weekend will get slightly higher in intensity<br>
and will even include an extra run on Saturday (we'll even include a short<br>
swim once or twice to give you the total triathlon experience). This extension<br>
of activity should also be building your confidence that you can complete<br>
a full Ironman distance race, if that's what your future goals include.<br>
You'll notice that we haven't included<br>
an indoor alternative for Saturday -- this is because we want you to ride<br>
outdoors, if at all possible. If the weather is cold and rainy on Saturday,<br>
feel free to switch the two days and try for Sunday; if Sunday's weather<br>
is equally unattractive, then go ahead and choose an indoor alternative<br>
from a previous weekly schedule.<br>
The bottom line is that we'd really<br>
like you to get outside this weekend, on both days, for an extended "Iron<br>
Weekend" of great outdoor training. Have a great time with it!<br>
Saturday, 6/14<br>
<br>
BIKE 3:30<br>
You should still be scheduling all of<br>
your longer weekend rides outdoors, weather permitting. In fact, if the<br>
weather is poor on Saturday and the forecast calls for improved weather<br>
on Sunday, then we'd recommend that you switch the two days to enable you<br>
to get some long "road time".<br>

You might find it helpful to mentally<br>
break this run into 35:00 chunks. I always find that to be more manageable<br>
than a full hour, for some reason, and it helps maintain the focus throughout<br>
this longer duration.<br>
Spend the first 20:00 getting into it, watching your<br>
HR slowly get above 60%<br>
2 x 20:00 @75% w/5:00 @60-65% in between<br>
BIKE 0:30<br>

yourself here -- time to up the tempo and close out your week with a bang.<br>

        Saturday<br>
This is one of the epic "Iron Days"<br>
that you'll have prior to your race, to instill confidence that your body,<br>
your equipment, and your fueling strategies are going to be where you need<br>
them to get through your big day. Approach this weekend as one big challenge,<br>
and have fun with it!<br>
<br>
SWIM 0:30<br>
This can be put in either first thing<br>
in the day -- to simulate the order in a triathlon -- or last in the day,<br>
to enable a more complete recovery. And, if you're completely shot, you<br>
can also skip this entirely (believe me, I've been there!).<br>
800 warmup swim, gradually getting your HR from 60-70%<br>
If you're doing this workout last, then<br>
reverse the intensities<br>

400 @65% - 300 @70% - 200 @75% - 100 @80%<br>
BIKE 4:35<br>
Get psyched, be prepared, bring along<br>
enough spare tires, and test out your fueling strategies here. I've always<br>
found it more realistic and manageable (though mentally challenging) to<br>
break this kind of ride into multiple loops, with each one ending back<br>
at the house, to help simulate an aid station -- more like the "turnaround<br>
point"!<br>

RUN 0:50<br>
Remember, the duration is really what<br>
counts, and you're all teaching your bodies what they will need to do to<br>
keep going and going...<br>
Again here, plan to have substantial aid<br>
available before and during this effort. You're likely dehydrated after<br>
your ride (it's much harder to gauge how thirsty you are on the bike),<br>
and you'll benefit from your run much more if you approach it slowly and<br>
gradually.<br>
Break this into multiple loops if necessary,<br>
and keep going!<br>

Sunday, 6/29<br>
What's in store after yesterday? You<br>
can view this as being the "rest of the run" -- or a "bike sandwich" as<br>
it's been known to be called. You'll begin with essentially no legs, and<br>
slowly you'll find life returning to them. Then you'll hop on your big<br>
for an extension of the run, which will hopefully also help circulate the<br>
blood and help you feel stronger. And finally, you'll finish with your<br>
final "victory lap" to the finish...<br>
<br>
RUN 1:20<br>
I've found it easiest here to break this<br>
into 40 minute segments, preferably as loops that begin and end at the<br>
house -- it's sometimes even better if it's broken into one 50-minute and<br>
one 30-minute segment following different routes. Keep your HR below 70%<br>
throughout, which after yesterday shouldn't be too tough...<br>
BIKE 1:00<br>
This can be done on the road for the sake<br>
of more scenery, though the intensity (hold it under 70% here as well)<br>
will be easier to control indoors.<br>
If you're inside, break it up as follows:<br>
3 aerobic intervals @60-70% intensity w/3:00 recovery<br>
after each:<br>
- #1 (8.4mi / 13km / 22:00)<br>
- #2 (5.6mi / 9km / 17:00)<br>
- #3 (2.8mi / 5km / 9:00)<br>
RUN 0:40<br>
Then it's back outside for your final<br>
"victory lap"!<br>

WARM UP<br>
400 Swim - 200 IM - 200 Choice<br>
MAIN SET<br>
Try to keep your stroke count<br>
even throughout the set. As you fatigue, concentrate on perfect technique--shoulder<br>
roll, tight streamlines off the walls, stretch out stroke in front and<br>
finish it back at your hip.<br>

Standard track workout format<br>
-- use the suggested times only if you can't get to a track.<br>
20:00 easy jog, gradually raising your HR<br>
to 70%<br>
- finish with 1-2 laps of accelerated running<br>
down the straightaways to get you ready for the main set:<br>
We're working towards more pure<br>
speed mixed with endurance. We want you to be getting faster but also becoming<br>
able to sustain faster speeds in races. Isn't that what it's all about<br>
anyway? This workout is to be done on a trail or bike path. The road is<br>
OK too, but running at the track isn't necessary, though it can be done<br>
there.<br>
12 x (2:00 fast/1:00 easy jog)<br>
Start at a little slower than your 10k effort<br>
(about 85-88%) and try to make each repeat slightly faster so that the<br>
last few are faster than 5k speed.<br>
Avoid starting out too fast. If you do, you<br>
will burn out and be running more slowly despite the fact that your HR<br>
is at 95% or higher. Try to remain consistent on your effort/speed of the<br>
recovery jogs. Do them very slowly, but keep them even.<br>
Jog easy @60% or below to the end -- walk<br>
backwards to stretch out yout calves and hamstrings the last 2-3:00 to<br>
complete your cool down<br>

By adding IM work to a swim<br>
workout, you will get a lot more out of the time you are puttin in the<br>
pool because you'll be working a broader range of muscles and you'll be<br>

your time in the pool, your swimming will improve.<br>

You can choose to do the<br>
swim right before biking as a prep for the first transition at your Ironman<br>
race, or you can do it afterwards to serve as a recovery as sorts. Whatever<br>
works out best for your schedule.<br>
It's best to ride outdoors,<br>
even if the weather is suspect. That way, you will be used to varying conditions<br>
which you will more than likely encounter on race day.

- 800 (2 laps)<br>
- 200 (1/2 lap)<br>
-- take an extra 800m in between the sets<br>
The fast running adds up to 2600m and should be done<br>
in the 88-95% range, so do it as fast as you can while making sure you<br>
don't burn out your engine prematurely. Each set should be the same or<br>
the second should get slightly faster. If your times get slower, then you<br>
started the set too fast. Jog the easy 200s and the 800 at a consistent<br>
pace below 65% -- don't allow these to slow down as you get more tired.<br>

Weekend Note:<br>
We've had a lot of questions about<br>
what intensities these weekend workouts need to be at since we don't offer<br>
set parameters. The goal is to push yourself as hard as you can while staying<br>
aerobic -- below 84% for sure and under 75% as much as possible. The most<br>
important aspect is simply putting in the time so that your body feels<br>
the duration of an Ultra distance race is no big deal (though the effort<br>
you put in might be!).

bringing your HR under 60% by the end. Walk 2-3:00 to complete the cool<br>
down process.<br>

If you have a choice, do the workout<br>
of the sport in which you need the most help first. If you're a strong<br>
swimmer, do the bike workout first, or visa versa. Keep this in mind every<br>

you are most fresh and they will more quickly become your strengths!<br>

MAIN SET<br>
Today's set is a simple variation<br>
of last week's. Greg LeMond used the 3 x 5:00 set often to increase his<br>
power output on the bike; I'm altering it for you to add spice to the routine.<br>
One time through the following set. All<br>
the hard repeats are done @ 92+% with an equal amount of recovery time<br>
@ 50-60%<br>
5:00 fast/5:00 easy<br>
4:00 fast/4:00 easy<br>
3:00 fast/3:00 easy<br>
2:00 fast/2:00 easy<br>
1:00 fast/1:00 easy<br>
You'll have to put more effort into each repeat<br>
to get your HR above 92%, so be aggressive while staying relaxed.<br>
COOL DOWN<br>
After the 1:00 easy, hold your HR at 70-75%<br>
for 25:00 before gradually slowing down to 60% with 10:00 left, and finally<br>

on your feet.<br>
After warming up, do 11 cycles of the following:<br>

jog easy for 3:00 after each hard repeat<br>
Avoid starting out too fast on the 2000 --<br>
you want to feel a definite increase in your effort and pace during the<br>
first three repeats. The 800 and 400 should be pretty challenging and harder<br>
to increase your speed on.<br>
Jog easy @60% or below to the end -- walk<br>
backwards to stretch out yout calves and hamstrings the last 2-3:00 to<br>
complete your cool down.<br>

10:00 @ 75%<br>
5:00 @ 65-70%<br>
There should be a definite change in your<br>
pace from the longer repeats to the short and back into the long ones.<br>
Keep your upper body and breathing relaxed. And keep your stride rate at<br>
90-95.<br>
Cooldown to 1:15 by brining your HR below<br>
60% with atleast 5:00 left.<br>
BIKE 1:30<br>
WARM UP<br>
15:00 spinning @90-95rpm<br>
- get your HR up to 60% in the first 10:00<br>
and closer to 70% by 15:00<br>
MAIN SET<br>
3 x 18:00 @ 75% with 4:00 @ 65-70% between<br>
repeats.<br>
Hold 90-95rpm throughout the set. Choose gears<br>
that allow you to pedal fairly easily instead of having to exert too much<br>
effort to keep your cadence up.<br>
This is the major difference in pedaling between<br>
shorter races and Ultra races. In shorter ones, the idea is to constantly<br>
maximize your effort. In Ultra races, the idea is to get as much speed<br>
as you can with as little effort exerted as possible.<br>
COOL DOWN<br>
Spin easy in your small chain ring @95+rpm,<br>
allowing your HR to return to 50% for<br>
the final few minutes.<br>

SWIM 1:00<br>
WARM UP<br>
9 x 100, alternate 100 Swim - 100 Kick - 100<br>
Pull; increase your effort in each set of 3 x 100<br>
MAIN SET<br>
3 sets of the following:<br>
10 x 50 w/:05 rest<br>
200 (or 150) easy on 4:00<br>
Get your time for every 50 and add them up<br>
for a timed 500. Try to make your times faster on set #2 and #3. Start<br>
set #1 at your race pace.<br>
Try to hold your 50s even. If your times drop<br>
off, it's because you started out too fast.<br>
COOL DOWN<br>
4 x 100 total recovery below 60%<br>
RUN 1:05<br>
We're going to keep the repeats<br>
short with minimal rest, so you can build some final strength and speed.<br>
15:00 easy jog, gradually raising your HR<br>
to 70%<br>
- finish with 1-2 laps of accelerated running<br>
down the straightaways to get you ready for the main set:<br>
16 sets of the following:<br>
400m (1:45) @ 80-85% (final four up to<br>
92%)<br>
100m (:30) @ 65% easy jog<br>
The key is to keep your effort and times for<br>
the 400s (if done at the track) as consistent as possible. The effort should<br>
feel similar to that of a fresh marathon pace (not at the end of an Ironman).<br>
Pick up your pace the last four repeats, making<br>
each one faster so the last one is nearly all out but still very much controlled.<br>
You should finish feeling like you could have done 1-2 more repeats as<br>
fast as you complete #16.<br>
Cooldown by jogging below 60% to the end.<br>
Walk it in the final couple of minutes and stretch out the calves, glutes<br>
and hamstrings.<br>

Weekend Note:<br>
The long ride and run have<br>
gone back up in time this weekend. We need to keep your body in touch with<br>
the long efforts you'll be putting it through on race day, but without<br>
having you be out there all day long. This weekend's workouts are a perfect<br>
compromise.<br>
Next week the run will get<br>
shorter and the ride will stay virtually the same.

BIKE 4:25<br>
Keep your effort aerobic. No<br>
hard group rides.<br>
 <br>
Bike aid stations are usually<br>
set 5 miles apart, so work on taking in fluids consistently atleast every<br>
15 minutes. Set your watch to beep every 15 minutes if you can to remind<br>
yourself to take in fuel. The less you have to think about during the race<br>
the better!<br>
RUN 0:30<br>
Brick run right after biking.<br>
Push the pace right away at a pace slightly faster than what you want to<br>
run your marathon at. Your HR should not exceed 85%.<br>
Run the whole 30:00 at this<br>
pace. Then finish up by walking for atleast 10 minutes and stretching out<br>
afterwards.<br>

RUN 1:45<br>
After 15:00 of warming up, hold<br>
your HR at 70-75% until the 1:10 mark. Then bump up your HR into the 75-84%<br>
range for 20 minutes before cooling down completely.<br>
By speeding up the last several<br>
miles at the end of a long run, you're teaching your body to push harder<br>
when it's already tired. If the 20:00 at 75-84% are comfortable, then you're<br>
making great progress towards a great marathon.<br>
Walk it in the final couple<br>
minutes. Then stretch out your calves, glutes and hamstrings.<br>
BIKE 0:45<br>
Keep your HR below 65% and spin<br>

Your legs may be a little heavy after yesterday,<br>
especially if you do the run first today. That's OK because you aren't<br>
building up any lactate during aerobic activity.<br>
Be sure to get your HR above 70% during the<br>
long repeats, keep your cadence at 90-95 rpm and stay aero the whole time<br>
if you can.<br>

MAIN SET<br>
3 sets of the following:<br>
4 x 125 w/:15 rest<br>
200 (or 150) easy on 4:00<br>
This is another set of broken 500s. Get your<br>
time for each 125 within a set and add it up for a timed 500. These should<br>
be a lot faster than if you swam 500 continuous, but your HR should stay<br>
below 92%. Fast but controlled is the name of the game.<br>
Increase your effort from 80-90+% within each<br>
set of 125s -- the first one is at 80% and each one gets faster so that<br>
#4 is at 90+%.<br>

1600m (7:00) @ 80-85% (final lap up to<br>
92%)<br>
400m (2:00) @ 65% easy jog<br>
The first 1200 of each repeat is essentially<br>
at your "fresh" marathon pace. The final 400, definitely pick up the pace<br>
so it is closer (but not quite at) 10k pace. Again, no all out efforts.<br>
After your 4th 1600, go right into your cooldown.<br>
Cooldown by jogging below 60% to the end.<br>

BIKE 2:30<br>
Aerobic effort the entire ride<br>
-- below 80%.<br>
No matter how good you are<br>
starting to feel during the taper, keep in mind that race day is where<br>
you want to "strut your stuff." Keep your HR and your excitement under<br>
control during this ride.<br>
Be smart and ride early before<br>
it gets hotter than blazes outside.<br>
RUN 0:35<br>
Sandwiched between a 10:00 warmup<br>
and 5:00 cooldown, hold your HR at 70-75% for 20 minutes.<br>
Complete this run later in the<br>
day, after your legs have recovered from the ride. Finishing up an hour<br>
or so before a meal is a great idea, as the meal will serve to refuel your<br>
body.<br>
Finish the day by drinking lots<br>
and lots of water and stretching out your whole body.<br>

Weekend Note:<br>
You've put in the work and<br>
tapered well, so now just enjoy the experience.<br>
Give yourself enough time<br>
to get to the transition area, signed in and ready to race without having<br>
to rush through the process. The more relaxed the morning can be, the better<br>
you will race.<br>
Everything should be a smooth,<br>
relaxed process on Race Day.<br>
Saturday<br>
Swim in the morning for<br>
20-30 minutes, beginning at the same time that the race will begin. <br>
Relax afterward and mentally walk through tomorrow's race.  You're<br>
in great shape, so have fun with it!<br>
Sunday<br>
RACE DAY!<br>
You already have your pre-race<br>
ritual down, so don't change anything. It's different for everyone, so<br>
the only advice we can give you is to:<br>
1) make sure you arrive at the<br>
transition area in plenty of time so you aren't rushed; and<br>
2) make sure you warm up properly.<br>
This is what it's all about.<br>
Have a lot of fun out there today, but also kick some butt!! Please let<br>
us know how you do!!<br>
POST RACE<br>
Congratulations! You did it!!<br>
Soak it all in, the adulations is as much for you as anyone else there!<br>
